== Magic 8 ball exercise

1. A Magic 8 ball can be shaken and will return "yes", "no", or "maybe."
It should return them evenly (1/3 chance for each).

2. PlayerA will shake the magic 8 ball until she gets a clear "yes" or "no."

3. PlayerB really likes the answer "yes."  He will shake the magic 8 ball up 
to 3 times to get a "yes."  If he can't get one, he will accept whatever the 
3rd answer is.
